## Overview

Bitbucket plugin is designed to offer integration between Bitbucket and Jenkins.

It exposes a single URI endpoint that you can add as a WebHook within each Bitbucket project you wish to integrate with. This single endpoint receives a full data payload from Bitbucket upon push (see their documentation), triggering compatible jobs to build based on changed repository/branch.
